#4.. Transpose Matrix: Write a Python program to transpose a given matrix represented as a nested list.
lists = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
rows = len(lists)
cols = len(lists[0])
transpose_list = []
for i in range(rows):
    new = []
    for j in range(cols):
        new.append(lists[j][i])
    transpose_list.append(new)
print(transpose_list)
